# Codebasics-Resume-Challenge
I recently participated in the Codebasics Resume Challenge where I worked on the case of Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old newspaper struggling to survive in the post-COVID digital era.

📊 Using 5 years of circulation, ad revenue, and digital pilot data, I analyzed how the company went from printing over 1.2M copies daily in 2019 to less than 560K by 2024, with ad revenues also falling.

Some key findings from my analysis:
Print waste rose to ~10% – Jaipur had the highest circulation but also the highest inefficiency.
Patna, despite lower circulation, delivered the strongest ROI thanks to stable government & real estate ads and higher digital engagement.
Advertiser value is shifting from bulk circulation → digital engagement.
Cities like Bhopal, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow show high digital readiness, making them prime candidates for a digital-first relaunch.

🔑 Based on this, I recommended a 3-Phase Strategy:
1️⃣ Relaunch in priority cities with a mobile-first platform and WhatsApp delivery.
2️⃣ Diversify content formats (short videos, podcasts, infographics).
3️⃣ Scale and monetize with subscriptions, loyalty programs, and pay-per-article.

🛠 Through this project, I applied skills in data analysis (Excel, SQL, Python), visualization (Power BI) and business storytelling to craft a sustainable roadmap for Bharat Herald’s digital future.
This challenge taught me that data isn’t just about numbers — it’s about connecting insights to real business strategy.
